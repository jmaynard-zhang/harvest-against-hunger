# harvest-against-hunger
The objective of this project is to bring visibility to Harvest Against Hunger, a non-profit hunger relief organization.

Specifically, through interactive data visualizations, this project will showcase the impact of its King County Farmers Share program. The visualizations will primarily consist of geographical and change-over-time data. These will also provide this organization a scalable template to showcase future programs.

Ultimately, this project will help Harvest Against Hunger advance its goals of connecting farmers, truckers, volunteers and food banks to reduce hunger and food waste.
